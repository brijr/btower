# Visions for Bridger

## My visions have been aligned according to my six pillars of human foundation: spiritual, physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and financial.

_Spiritually_ → I will be able to feel the spirit and be Directed by God

_Physically_ → I will be eating healthy and exercising often enjoying nature

_Intellectually_ → I will always be learning and reading/listening to new material

_Emotionally_ → I will have developed healthy ways to manage my stress and attitude

_Social_ → I will be very involved with my family, friends, and colleagues with an emphasis on charity.

_Financially_ → I will be striving to work towards 'big wins' and provide for my family and those who become dependent on me

## Another Version

1. Find peace, freedom, and friendship in Christ
2. Live mindfully, comfortably, and above all, gratefully
3. Give freely of the blessings I receive
4. Grow skills and talents to create Christ-like impact
5. Practice altruism in all that I do
6. Never stop learning and developing
